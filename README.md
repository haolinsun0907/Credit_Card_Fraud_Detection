# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
## Exploratory Data Analysis (Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
### Features:
- Show data summaries
- Check missing values
- Show class (legitimate vs fraudulent) distribution to understand the imbalance
- Time and Amount Analysis
- Understand PCA Features (plot a histogram of all PCA transformed features to check their distribution)
- Correlation Analysis (plot a heatmap to check for correlations between features, especially with the 'Class' variable)
- Boxplots for Anomaly Detection (for features that seem to have a correlation with the 'Class' variable, plot boxplots to visually inspect for differences in their distribution across classes)
